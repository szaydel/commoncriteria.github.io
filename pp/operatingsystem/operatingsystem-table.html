              <p>
		<b>Key Generation for FIPS PUB 186-4 RSA Schemes</b><br/>
		The evaluator will verify
              the implementation of RSA Key Generation by the OS using the Key
              Generation test. This test verifies the ability of the TSF to
              correctly produce values for the key components including the public verification
              exponent e, the private prime factors p and q, the public modulus n and the
              calculation of the private signature exponent d. Key Pair generation specifies 5 ways
              (or methods) to generate the primes p and q. These include:
	      <ol>
                <li> Random Primes:
		<ul>
                  <li>Provable primes</li>
                  <li>Probable primes</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Primes with Conditions: <ul>
                    <li>Primes p1, p2, q1,q2, p and q shall all be provable primes</li>
                    <li>Primes p1, p2, q1, and q2 shall be provable primes and p and q shall be
                      probable primes</li>
                    <li>Primes p1, p2, q1,q2, p and q shall all be probable primes</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
	      To test the key generation method for the Random Provable primes method and for
              all the Primes with Conditions methods, the evaluator must seed the TSF
	      key generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically
              generate the RSA key pair. This includes the random seed(s), the public exponent of
              the RSA key, and the desired key length. For each key length supported, the evaluator
              shall have the TSF generate 25 key pairs. The evaluator will verify
              the correctness of the TSF's implementation by comparing values
              generated by the TSF with those generated from a known good
              implementation.
	      </p><p>
	      If possible, the Random Probable primes method should also be
              verified against a known good implementation as described above. Otherwise, the
              evaluator will have the TSF generate 10 keys pairs for each
              supported key length nlen and verify: <ul>
                <li>n = p⋅q,</li>
                <li>p and q are probably prime according to Miller-Rabin tests,</li>
                <li>GCD(p-1,e) = 1,</li>
                <li>GCD(q-1,e) = 1,</li>
                <li>2<sup>16</sup> ≤ e ≤ 2<sup>256</sup> and e is an odd integer,</li>
                <li>|p-q| &gt; 2<sup>nlen/2 - 100</sup>,</li>
                <li>p ≥ 2<sup>nlen/2 -1/2</sup>,</li>
                <li>q ≥ 2<sup>nlen/2 -1/2</sup>,</li>
                <li>2<sup>(nlen/2)</sup> &lt; d &lt; LCM(p-1,q-1),</li>
                <li>e⋅d = 1 mod LCM(p-1,q-1).</li>
              </ul>

              <b>Key Generation for Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)</b>
	      <p> FIPS 186-4 ECC Key Generation Test</p>
              For each supported NIST curve, i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521, the
              evaluator will require the implementation under test (IUT) to generate 10
              private/public key pairs. The private key shall be generated using an approved random
              bit generator (RBG). To determine correctness, the evaluator will submit the
              generated key pairs to the public key verification (PKV) function of a known good
              implementation.
	     </p>
	      <p>FIPS 186-4 Public Key Verification (PKV) Test</p>
	      <p>
	      For each supported
              NIST curve, i.e., P-256, P-384 and P-521, the evaluator will generate 10
              private/public key pairs using the key generation function of a known good
              implementation and modify five of the public key values so that they are incorrect,
              leaving five values unchanged (i.e., correct). The evaluator will obtain in response
              a set of 10 PASS/FAIL values.

	      </p>
	      <p>
              <b>Key Generation for Finite-Field Cryptography (FFC)</b>
              <br/>
              The evaluator will verify the implementation of the Parameters Generation
              and the Key Generation for FFC by the TOE using the Parameter Generation
              and Key Generation test.
	      This test verifies the ability of the TSF to correctly
              produce values for the field prime p, the cryptographic prime q (dividing p-1),
              the cryptographic group generator g, and the calculation of the private
              key x and public key y.
	      </p><p>
              The Parameter generation specifies 2 ways (or methods) to generate the
              cryptographic prime q and the field prime p:
              <br/>
              
              <li>Cryptographic and Field Primes:<ul>
                <li>Primes q and p shall both be provable primes</li>
                <li>Primes q and field prime p shall both be probable primes</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              and two ways to generate the cryptographic group generator g:
              
              <li>Cryptographic Group Generator:<ul>
                <li>Generator g constructed through a verifiable process</li>
                <li>Generator g constructed through an unverifiable process</li>
              </ul>
              </li>

              The Key generation specifies 2 ways to generate the private key x:
              
              <li>Private Key:<ul>
                <li>len(q) bit output of RBG where 1 ≤ x ≤ q-1</li>
                <li>len(q) + 64 bit output of RBG, followed by a mod q-1 operation where 1 ≤ x ≤ q-1</li>
              </ul>
              </li>
              
              The security strength of the RBG must be at least that of the security offered by the FFC parameter set.
              
              To test the cryptographic and field prime generation method for the provable primes method and/or the
              group generator g for a verifiable process, the evaluator must seed the TSF parameter
              generation routine with sufficient data to deterministically generate the parameter set.
              
              For each key length supported, the evaluator will have the TSF generate 25 parameter sets
              and key pairs. The evaluator will verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation
              by comparing values generated by the TSF with those generated from a known good
              implementation. Verification must also confirm:
              <ul>

	      The evaluator will verify the OS's
              implementation of SP800-56A key agreement schemes using the following Function and
              Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme verify that the OS
              has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme according to the
              specifications in the Recommendation. These components include the calculation of the
              discrete logarithm cryptography (DLC) primitives (the shared secret value Z) and the
              calculation of the derived keying material (DKM) via the Key Derivation Function
              (KDF). If key confirmation is supported, the evaluator will also verify that the
              components of key confirmation have been implemented correctly, using the test
              procedures described below. This includes the parsing of the DKM, the generation of
              MAC data and the calculation of MAC tag. <br/>



		<div style="margin-left: 40px">
		  <b>Function Test</b>
		  <p>The Function test verifies the ability of the OS to implement the key agreement schemes correctly.
To conduct this test the evaluator will generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the OS's supported schemes.
For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors.
The data set consists of the NIST approved curve (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys.
These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
	      </p>
	      <p> The evaluator will obtain the DKM, the
                corresponding OS's public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and any
                inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and OS id fields.
	      </p>
	      <p>
                If the OS does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A, the evaluator will
                obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of the shared secret.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		The
                evaluator will verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of a given scheme
                by using a known good implementation to calculate the shared secret value, derive
                the keying material DKM, and compare hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.
	      </p>
	      <p>
                If key confirmation is supported, the OS shall perform the above for each
                implemented approved MAC algorithm.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		<b>Validity Test</b><br/>
		<p> The Validity test verifies the ability of the OS to
                recognize another party's valid and invalid key agreement results with or without
                key confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator will obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A key agreement
                implementation to determine which errors the OS should be able to recognize. The
                evaluator generates a set of 30 test vectors consisting of data
                sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves, the evaluator's
                public keys, the OS's public/private key pairs, MAC tag, and any inputs used in the
                KDF, such as the other info and OS id fields.
		</p>
		<p>
		The evaluator will inject an
                error in some of the test vectors to test that the OS recognizes invalid key
                agreement results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret
                value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the data to be MAC'd, or the
                generated MAC tag. If the OS contains the full or partial (only ECC) public key
                validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors in both parties'
                static public keys, both parties' ephemeral public keys and the OS's static private
                key to assure the OS detects errors in the public key validation function and/or
                the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At least two of the test vectors
                shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in valid key agreement results
                (they should pass).
		</p>
		<p>
		  The OS shall use these modified test vectors to emulate
                  the key agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator will
                  compare the OS's results with the results using a known good implementation
                  verifying that the OS detects these errors.

	      <p>
The interface referenced in the requirement could take different forms, 
the most likely of which is an application programming interface to an OS kernel. 
There may be various levels of abstraction visible.
For instance, in a given implementation that overwrites a key stored in non-volatile memory, 
the application may have access to the file system details and 
may be able to logically address specific memory locations.
In another implementation, that instructs the underlying platform to destroy the 
representation of a key stored in non-volatile memory, 
the application may simply have a handle to a resource and 
can only ask the platform to delete the resource, as may be the case with a platforms secure key store.
The latter implementation should only be used for the most restricted access.
The level of detail to which the TOE has access will be reflected in the TSS section of the ST.
	      </p>
        <p>
Several selections allow assignment of a 'value that does not contain any CSP'.
This means that the TOE uses some other specified data not drawn from a source that 
may contain key material or reveal information about key material, 
and not being any of the particular values listed as other selection options. 
The point of the phrase 'does not contain any CSP' is to ensure that the overwritten 
data is carefully selected, and not taken from a general 'pool' that might contain current or 
residual data that itself requires confidentiality protection.
	      </p>
	      <p>      
For the selection <i>destruction of all key encrypting keys protecting target key according
to FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1, where none of the KEKs protecting the target key are derived</i>,
a key can be considered destroyed by destroying the key that protects the key.
If a key is wrapped or encrypted it is not necessary to “overwrite” that key,
overwriting the key that is used to wrap or encrypt the key used to encrypt/decrypt data,
using the appropriate method for the memory type involved, will suffice.
For example, if a product uses a Key Encryption Key (KEK) to encrypt a Data Encryption Key
(DEK), destroying the KEK using one of the methods in FCS_CKM_EXT.4 is sufficient, 
since the DEK would no longer be usable (of course, presumes the DEK is still encrypted 
and the KEK cannot be recovered or re-derived.).

	      <h3>Operational Guidance</h3>
	      <p>
There are a variety of concerns that may prevent or delay key destruction in some cases. The evaluator will check that the guidance documentation identifies configurations or circumstances that may not strictly conform to the key destruction requirement, and that this description is consistent with the relevant parts of the TSS and any other relevant Required Supplementary Information. The evaluator will check that the guidance documentation provides guidance on situations where key destruction may be delayed at the physical layer and how such situations can be avoided or mitigated if possible.
	      </p>
	      <p>
Some examples of what is expected to be in the documentation are provided here.
	      </p>
	      <p>
When the TOE does not have full access to the physical memory, it is possible that the storage may be implementing wear-leveling and garbage collection. This may create additional copies of the key that are logically inaccessible but persist physically. In this case, to mitigate this the drive should support the TRIM command and implements garbage collection to destroy these persistent copies when not actively engaged in other tasks.
	      </p>
	      <p>
Drive vendors implement garbage collection in a variety of different ways, as such there is a variable amount of time until data is truly removed from these solutions. There is a risk that data may persist for a longer amount of time if it is contained in a block with other data not ready for erasure. To reduce this risk, the operating system and file system of the OE should support TRIM, instructing the non-volatile memory to erase copies via garbage collection upon their deletion. If a RAID array is being used, only set-ups that support TRIM are utilized. If the drive is connected via PCI-Express, the operating system supports TRIM over that channel.
	      </p>
	      <p>
The drive should be healthy and contains minimal corrupted data and should be end-of-lifed before a significant amount of damage to drive health occurs, this minimizes the risk that small amounts of potentially recoverable data may remain in damaged areas of the drive.

  The test succeeds if step 3 fails.
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Test 3: </b>
  <p>
Tests 3 and 4 do not apply for the selection 
<i>instructing the underlying platform to destroy the representation of the key</i>
as the TOE has no visibility into the inner workings and completely relies on the underlying platform.
  </p>
  <p>
The following tests are used to determine if the TOE is able to request the platform to overwrite the key with a TOE supplied pattern.
  </p>
<p>

Applied to each key held in non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE. The evaluator will use a tool that provides a logical view of the media (e.g., MBR file system):
<ol>
<li>Record the value of the key in the TOE subject to clearing.</li>

<li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.</li>

<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</li>

<li>Search the logical view that the key was stored in for instances of the known key value from Step #1. If a copy is found, then the test fails.</li>
</ol>
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Test 4: </b> Applied to each key held as non-volatile memory and subject to destruction by overwrite by the TOE. The evaluator will use a tool that provides a logical view of the media:
<ol>
<li>Record the logical storage location of the key in the TOE subject to clearing.</li>

<li>Cause the TOE to perform a normal cryptographic processing with the key from Step #1.</li>

<li>Cause the TOE to clear the key.</li>

<li>Read the logical storage location in Step #1 of non-volatile memory to ensure the appropriate pattern is utilized.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  The test succeeds if correct pattern is used to overwrite the key in the memory location. If the pattern is not found the test fails.

              <b>AES-CBC Known Answer Tests</b>
	      </p>
	      <p>
		There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs), described below. In all KATs, the
              plaintext, ciphertext, and IV values shall be 128-bit blocks. The results from each
              test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs to
              the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness, the
              evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same
              inputs to a known good implementation. <ul>
                <li>KAT-1. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 plaintext values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from
                  AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a key value of all zeros and an IV
                  of all zeros. Five plaintext values shall be encrypted with a 128-bit all-zeros
                  key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all- zeros key. To test
                  the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the same test as
                  for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input and AES-CBC decryption.</li>
                <li>KAT-2. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  a set of 10 key values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from AES-CBC
                  encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value and an IV of all
                  zeros. Five of the keys shall be 128-bit keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit
                  keys. To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform
                  the same test as for encrypt, using an all-zero ciphertext value as input and
                  AES-CBC decryption.</li>
                <li>KAT-3. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  the two sets of key values described below and obtain the ciphertext value that
                  results from AES encryption of an all-zeros plaintext using the given key value
                  and an IV of all zeros. The first set of keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the
                  second set shall have 256 256-bit keys. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost
                  i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. To test the
                  decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply the two sets of key
                  and ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value that
                  results from AES-CBC decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key and an
                  IV of all zeros. The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit
                  key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256
                  256-bit key/ciphertext pairs. Key i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be
                  ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros, for i in [1,N]. The ciphertext value in
                  each pair shall be the value that results in an all-zeros plaintext when decrypted
                  with its corresponding key.</li>
                <li>KAT-4. To test the encrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will supply
                  the set of 128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext
                  values that result from AES-CBC encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit
                  key value of all zeros with an IV of all zeros and using a 256-bit key value of
                  all zeros with an IV of all zeros, respectively. Plaintext value i in each set
                  shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for
                  i in [1,128].</li>
              </ul>
	      <br/>
	      To test the decrypt functionality of AES-CBC, the evaluator will perform the
              same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext values of the same form as the plaintext in
              the encrypt test as input and AES-CBC decryption.
	      </p>
              <b>AES-CBC Multi-Block Message Test</b>
	      <p>
              The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block
              message where 1 &lt; i ≤ 10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and plaintext
              message of length i blocks and encrypt the message, using the mode to be tested, with
              the chosen key and IV. The ciphertext shall be compared to the result of encrypting
              the same plaintext message with the same key and IV using a known good implementation.
              The evaluator will also test the decrypt functionality for each mode by decrypting an
              i-block message where 1 &lt; i ≤10. The evaluator will choose a key, an IV and a
              ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode to be
              tested, with the chosen key and IV. The plaintext shall be compared to the result of
              decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key and IV using a known good
              implementation.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <b>AES-CBC Monte Carlo Tests</b>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The evaluator will test the encrypt
              functionality using a set of 200 plaintext, IV, and key 3- tuples. 100 of these shall
              use 128 bit keys, and 100 shall use 256 bit keys. The plaintext and IV values shall be
              128-bit blocks. For each 3-tuple, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:
              <pre>
              # Input: PT, IV, Key
              for i = 1 to 1000:
                if i == 1:
                      CT[1] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, IV, PT)
                      PT = IV
                else:
                  CT[i] = AES-CBC-Encrypt(Key, PT)
                  PT = CT[i-1]
              </pre>The
              ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration (i.e., CT[1000]) is the result for that
              trial. This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 iterations with the
              same values using a known good implementation.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The evaluator will test the
              decrypt functionality using the same test as for encrypt, exchanging CT and PT and
              replacing AES-CBC-Encrypt with AES-CBC-Decrypt.
	    </p>
	    <p>
              <b>AES-GCM Monte Carlo Tests</b>
              <p/>The evaluator will test the authenticated encrypt functionality of AES-GCM for
              each combination of the following input parameter lengths: <ul>
                <li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</li>
                <li>Two plaintext lengths. One of the plaintext lengths shall be a non-zero integer
                  multiple of 128 bits, if supported. The other plaintext length shall not be an
                  integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</li>
                <li>Three AAD lengths. One AAD length shall be 0, if supported. One AAD length shall
                  be a non-zero integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported. One AAD length shall not
                  be an integer multiple of 128 bits, if supported.</li>
                <li>Two IV lengths. If 96 bit IV is supported, 96 bits shall be one of the two IV
                  lengths tested.</li>
              </ul>The evaluator will test the encrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              plaintext, AAD, and IV tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above and
              obtain the ciphertext value and tag that results from AES-GCM authenticated encrypt.
              Each supported tag length shall be tested at least once per set of 10. The IV value
              may be supplied by the evaluator or the implementation being tested, as long as it is
              known.
	    </p>
	    <p>


	      The evaluator will test the decrypt functionality using a set of 10 key,
              ciphertext, tag, AAD, and IV 5-tuples for each combination of parameter lengths above
              and obtain a Pass/Fail result on authentication and the decrypted plaintext if Pass.
              The set shall include five tuples that Pass and five that Fail.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The results from
              each test may either be obtained by the evaluator directly or by supplying the inputs
              to the implementer and receiving the results in response. To determine correctness,
              the evaluator will compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the
              same inputs to a known good implementation.

              <p><b>AES-CCM Tests</b></p>
	      <p>
              The evaluator will test the generation-encryption and decryption-verification
              functionality of AES-CCM for the following input parameter and tag lengths: <ul>
                <li>128 bit and 256 bit keys</li>
                <li>Two payload lengths. One payload length shall be the shortest supported payload
                  length, greater than or equal to zero bytes. The other payload length shall be the
                  longest supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits).
                </li>
                <li>Two or three associated data lengths. One associated data length shall be 0, if
                  supported. One associated data length shall be the shortest supported payload length,
                  greater than or equal to zero bytes. One associated data length shall be the longest
                  supported payload length, less than or equal to 32 bytes (256 bits). If the
                  implementation supports an associated data length of 2
                  16 bytes, an associated data length of 216 bytes shall be tested.
                </li>
                <li>Nonce lengths. All supported nonce lengths between 7 and 13 bytes, inclusive, shall
                  be tested.

		The TSF
              hashing functions can be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the

              are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e., the length (in bits) of the message
              to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is the bit-oriented mode. In this mode
              the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. As there are different
              tests for each mode, an indication is given in the following sections for the
              bit-oriented vs. the byte-oriented testmacs. The evaluator will perform all of the

              in conjunction with the uses that require those rules. The evaluator will create a
              chain of at least four certificates: the node certificate to be tested, two
              Intermediate CAs, and the self-signed Root CA. <ul xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
                <li><b>Test 1: </b> The evaluator will demonstrate that validating a certificate without a valid

                  a certificate or certificates as trusted CAs needed to validate the certificate to
                  be used in the function, and demonstrate that the function succeeds. The evaluator

                  revoked certificates-–conditional on whether CRL, OCSP, or OCSP stapling is selected;

                  revocation of the node certificate and revocation of the intermediate CA

                  CA). The evaluator will ensure that a valid certificate is used, and that the
                  validation function succeeds. The evaluator then attempts the test with a

                  signing purpose and verify that validation of the OCSP response fails. If CRL is

		  The "evaluation evidence required by the SARs" in this PP is limited to the
              information in the ST coupled with the guidance provided to
              administrators and users under the AGD requirements. By ensuring that the OS is specifically identified and that this identification is
              consistent in the ST and in the AGD guidance (as done in the
              evaluation activity for ALC_CMC.1), the evaluator implicitly confirms the information
              required by this component. Life-cycle support is targeted aspects of the developer's

              rather than an in-depth examination of the TSF manufacturer's
              development and configuration management process. This is not meant to diminish the
              critical role that a developer's practices play in contributing to the overall
              trustworthiness of a product; rather, it's a reflection on the information to be made
              available for evaluation.
	      </p><p>
	      The evaluator will ensure that the developer has
              identified (in guidance documentation for application developers concerning the
              targeted platform) one or more development environments appropriate for use in
              developing applications for the developer's platform. For each of these development
              environments, the developer shall provide information on how to configure the
              environment to ensure that buffer overflow protection mechanisms in the environment(s)
              are invoked (e.g., compiler and linker flags). The evaluator will ensure that this documentation
              also includes an indication of whether such protections are on by default, or have to
              be specifically enabled. The evaluator will ensure that the TSF is
              uniquely identified (with respect to other products from the TSF
              vendor), and that documentation provided by the developer in association with the
              requirements in the ST is associated with the TSF
              using this unique identification.

	      While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an evaluation activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the
                ST, the test plan provides a justification for not testing the
              platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
              platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not
              affect the testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the
              differences have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in
              the ST are tested, then no rationale is necessary. The test plan
              describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is
              necessary beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that
              the evaluator is expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup
              of each platform either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This
              may include special test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not
              just an assertion) should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely
              affect the performance of the functionality by the OS and its
              platform.
	      </p><p>
	      This also includes the configuration of the cryptographic engine to be
              used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by this engine are those specified by
              this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS). The test
              plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be
              followed to achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results.
	      </p><p>
              The test report (which could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details
              the activities that took place when the test procedures were executed, and includes
              the actual results of the tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a
              test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of
              the test, the report would show a "fail" and "pass" result (and the supporting
              details), and not just the "pass" result.

              either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or the evaluator
              formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the
              vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack vector
              needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.
