        <section id="over" title="Overview">
            The scope of this Extended Package (EP) is to describe the security functionality of a Client Virtualization product in terms of [CC] and to define functional and assurance requirements for such products. This EP is not complete in itself, but rather extends the Protection Profile for Virtualization (Base Virtualization PP). This is because Client Virtualization is a specific type of Virtualization System and is expected to implement security functionality that is not common to all Virtualization Systems in general. Therefore, additional SFRs have been defined in this EP to define security functionality that is unique to this particular type of Virtualization System.
        </section>
        <section id="terms" title="Terms">
            All relevant terminology for this EP are defined in the Base Virtualization PP.
        </section>
        <section id="targets" title="Compliant Targets of Evaluation">
            Client Virtualization, for the purposes of this EP, refers to a Virtualization System that implements virtualized hardware components locally on an endpoint machine. Endpoints are typically client hardware such as desktop or laptop computers that a user interacts with directly, but may also include headless embedded systems without direct human interaction. A Virtualization System creates a virtualized hardware environment for each instance of a guest operating system (a virtual machine) permitting these environments to execute concurrently while maintaining isolation and the appearance of exclusive control over assigned computing resources. Client virtualization is generally used on endpoint systems, making use of the local machine's resources (memory, CPU, etc.) to provide isolated user environments. This document does not address virtualization on mobile devices (typically devices that use a baseband processor and/or connect to a cellular network), nor does it address application virtualization or containers.
            <subsection id="bound" title="TOE Boundary">
                The TOE boundary is the same as that which is defined for a Virtualization System in general. Refer to the Base Virtualization PP for an outline of the TOE boundary.

        <section id="use" title="Use Cases">
            Requirements in this EP are designed to address the security problem in the following use cases. The description of these use cases provides instructions for how the TOE and its Operational Environment should be made to support the functionality required by this EP.
            <usecases>
            <usecase title="Locally Managed Client" id="locally">
                <description>
                    A local administrator creates and runs one or more VMs locally. This client could be stand-alone or connected to a network.
                </description>
            </usecase>
            <usecase title="Enterprise Managed Client" id="enterprise">
                <description>
                    An enterprise administrator for the VS centrally manages one or more client hypervisors, creating and configuring VMs which are then pushed to the clients. These VMs are then available for users on that client to run using the computing resources of that client. (Note that this is not Virtual Desktop Infrastructure where the hypervisors and the VMs run on remote servers. While both can be centrally managed and accessed from clients, for client virtualization, the VMs are local to the endpoint machine.) 
                </description>
            </usecase>
            <usecase title="Headless Client" id="headless">
                <description>
                    A VM is used by a program without direct human interaction.
                </description>
            </usecase>
            </usecases>
            The use case(s) that are applicable to the TOE may influence the selections and assignments made for certain requirements in both this EP and in the base PP. For example, a locally managed client (use case 1) may not necessarily provide remote administration which would exempt it from claiming the selection-based requirement FTP_TRP.1 in the base PP.

    <cclaims>
        <cclaim id="statement">
            <description>
                A product must be evaluated against the Client Virtualization EP in conjunction with the base Virtualization PP; a product may not be evaluated solely against the Client Virtualization EP. To be conformant to this EP, an ST must demonstrate Exact Conformance, a subset of Strict Conformance as defined in [CC] Part 1 (ASE_CCL). The ST must include all components in this EP that are:
                <ul xmlns="">    
                <li>Unconditional (which are always required)</li>
                <li>Selection-based (which are required when certain selections are chosen in the unconditional requirements)
                and may include components that are</li>
                <li>Optional</li>
                <li>Objective.</li>
                </ul>
                Unconditional requirements are found in the main body of the document (Section 5), while appendices contain the selection-based, optional, and objective requirements. The ST may iterate any of these components but it must not introduce any additional component (e.g., from CC Part 2 or 3) that is not defined in the Base Virtualization PP (which this EP extends), or in this EP itself.

        Note that as an EP of the Base Virtualization PP, all threats, assumptions, and OSPs defined in the base PP will also apply to a TOE unless otherwise specified, depending on which of the base PPs it extends. The Security Functional Requirements defined in this EP will mitigate the threats that are defined in the EP but may also mitigate some threats defined in the base PPs in more comprehensive detail due to the specific capabilities provided by a Client Virtualization System.

            The Base Virtualization PP defines requirements for generic virtualization systems, not all of which provide Client Virtualization functionality. Therefore, the SFRs defined in the base PP provide the ST author with a number of selections and assignments as well as optional and selection-based requirements in order to capture the entire set of virtualization systems that can be evaluated. This section provides the ST author with specific instructions that must be taken for including the relevant SFRs from the base PP when the TOE claims conformance to this EP in particular.<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
            At this time, there are no specific actions that must be taken with the base PP SFRs beyond ensuring that all mandatory SFRs are present, all selections and assignments are completed appropriately, and all selection-based SFRs are claimed based on the selections that are chosen.

    <appendix id="opt" title="Optional Requirements">
        As indicated in Section 2, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE) are contained in the body of this EP. Additionally, there are three other types of requirements specified in Appendix A, Appendix B, and Appendix C. The first type (in this Appendix) are requirements that can be included in the ST, but are not required in order for a TOE to claim conformance to this EP. The second type (in Appendix B) are requirements based on selections in the body of the EP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements in that appendix must be included. The third type (in Appendix C) are components that are not required in order to conform to this EP, but will be included in the baseline requirements in future versions of this EP, so adoption by vendors is encouraged. Note that the ST author is responsible for ensuring that requirements that may be associated with those in Appendix A, Appendix B, and Appendix C but are not listed (e.g., FMT-type requirements) are also included in the ST.<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
        Currently, no optional requirements specific to this product type have been identified.

        As indicated in the introduction to this EP, the baseline requirements (those that must be performed by the TOE or its underlying platform) are contained in the body of the EP. There are additional requirements based on selections in the body of the EP: if certain selections are made, then additional requirements below will need to be included.<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
        Currently, no selection-based requirements specific to this product type have been identified.

    <appendix id="obj-req" title="Objective Requirements">
        This Annex includes requirements that specify security functionality which also addresses threats. The requirements are not currently mandated in the body of this EP as they describe security functionality not yet widely available in commercial technology. However, these requirements may be included in the ST such that the TOE is still conformant to this EP, and it is expected that they be included as soon as possible.<br xmlns=""><br xmlns="">
        Currently, no objective requirements specific to this product type have been identified.

    <appendix id="ent" title="Entropy Documentation and Assessment">
        The TOE does not require any additional supplementary information to describe its entropy source(s) beyond the requirements outlined in the ‘Entropy Documentation and Assessment’ section of the Base Virtualization PP. As with other base PP requirements, the only additional requirement is that the entropy documentation also applies to the specific Client Virtualization capabilities of the TOE in addition to the functionality required by the base PP.
