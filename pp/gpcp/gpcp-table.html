				the list presented. The <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> author should update the table in FAU_GEN.1.2 with any additional
				information generated. “Subject identity” in FAU_GEN.1.2 could be a user id or an identifier specifying a 
				<a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a>, for example.<br/><br/>
                            If ‘additional information defined in Table 3’ is selected, it is acceptable to include individual
                            entries from Table 3 without including the entirety of Table 3.  Appropriate entries from Tables 2, 4,
                            and 5 should be included in the <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> if the associated SFRs and selections are included.
				<br/><br/>
                            The Table 1 entry for FDP_VNC_EXT.1 refers to configuration settings that attach <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a>s to 
				virtualized network components. Changes to these configurations can be made during <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> 
				execution or when <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a>s are not running. Audit records must be generated for either case.
				<br/><br/>
                            The intent of the audit requirement for FDP_PPR_EXT.1 is to log that the <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> is connected to a
				physical device (when the device becomes part of the <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a>’s hardware view), not to log every
				time that the device is accessed. Generally, this is only once at <a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> startup. However,
				some devices can be connected and disconnected during operation (e.g., virtual USB devices such as CD-ROMs). 
				All such connection/disconnection events must be logged.

                                evaluator shall ensure the audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the 
                                administrative guide, and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.<br/>

				<a class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a>s and/or the Management Subsystem. A measured launch process only allows components
				to be executed after the measurement has been recorded. An example process may add each component’s

				requirement on the Platform to take such measurements.<br/><br/>
                            If available, hardware should be used to store measurements in such a manner that they cannot be modified

				and reporting measurements.<br/><br/>
                            Platforms with a root of trust for measurement (RTM) should initiate the measured launch process. This may
				include core BIOS or the chipset. The chipset is the preferred RTM, but core BIOS or other firmware is
				acceptable. In system without a traditional RTM, the first component that boots would be considered
				the RTM, this is not preferred.

					    certificate owner. This may be supplied with the product initially, or may be obtained by
					    some other means.</li>
                                    <li>Instructions for obtaining the update itself. This should include instructions for making

                                The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing aspects of the system. 
				    While it is not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the 
				    evaluators must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in the 
				    <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> is covered.<br/><br/>
                                The Test Plan identifies the platforms to be tested, and for those platforms not included in the test 
				    plan but included in the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a>, the test plan provides a justification for not
				    testing the platforms. This justification must address the differences between the tested
				    platforms and the untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the
				    testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences have no affect;
				    rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> are tested, then
				    no rationale is necessary.<br/><br/>
                                The test plan describes the composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary
				    beyond what is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that the evaluators are
				    expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform either as
				    part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special test drivers or tools.
				    For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion) is provided that the driver or tool 
				    will not adversely affect the performance of the functionality by the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a> and
				    its platform. This also includes the configuration of cryptographic engines to be used. The 
				    cryptographic algorithms implemented by these engines are those specified by this PP and used by 
				    the cryptographic protocols being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH).<br/><br/>
                                The test plan identifies high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to
				    achieve those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which could
				    just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took place when the
				    test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the tests. This shall be a 
				    cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in a failure; a fix installed; and
				    then a successful re-run of the test, the report would show a “fail” and “pass” result (and the
				    supporting details), and not just the “pass” result.

        <td>As with ATE_IND the evaluator shall generate a report to document their findings with respect to
				this requirement. This report could physically be part of the overall test report mentioned in ATE_IND,
				or a separate document. The evaluator performs a search of public information to determine the
				vulnerabilities that have been found in virtualization in general, as well as those that pertain to
				the particular <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="abbr" href="#abbr_"><abbr title=""/></a>. The evaluator documents the sources consulted and the
				vulnerabilities found in the report. For each vulnerability found, the evaluator either provides a
				rationale with respect to its non-applicability or the evaluator formulates a test (using the
				guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm the vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined
				by assessing the attack vector needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. For example, if the
				vulnerability can be detected by pressing a key combination on boot-up, a test would be suitable at
				the assurance level of this PP. If exploiting the vulnerability requires expert skills and an electron
				microscope, for instance, then a test would not be suitable and an appropriate justification would be
				formulated.</td>
