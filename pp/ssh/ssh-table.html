          The evaluator shall examine the TSS to verify that it describes whether the TSF or TOE platform is responsible for the implementation of  
          the cryptographic functionality needed to support SSH communications.
          <p></p>

          There are no guidance evaluation activities for this component.
          
          
          If "perform" is selected, the evaluator shall perform the following tests:
          <ul xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
            <li>
<b>Test 1: </b>
              Known Answer Tests (KATs)
              <p></p>
              There are four Known Answer Tests (KATs) described below.  For all KATs, the plaintext,
              initialization vector (IV), and ciphertext values shall be 128-bit blocks.  The results from each test may
              either be obtained by the validator directly or by supplying the inputs to the implementer
              and receiving the results in response.  To determine correctness, the evaluator shall
              compare the resulting values to those obtained by submitting the same inputs to a known
              good implementation.
              <p></p>
              <b>Test 1a:</b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 plaintext 
              values and obtain the ciphertext value that results from encryption of the given plaintext
              using a key value of all zeros and an IV of all zeros.  Five plaintext values shall be encrypted
              with a 128-bit all zeros key, and the other five shall be encrypted with a 256-bit all zeros key. 
              To test the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall perform the same 
              test as for encrypt, using 10 ciphertext values as input.
              <p></p>
              <b>Test 1b:</b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply a set of 10 key values
              and obtain the ciphertext value that results from encryption of an all zeros plaintext
              using the given key value and an IV of all zeros.  Five of the key values shall be 128-bit
              keys, and the other five shall be 256-bit keys. To test the decrypt functionality, the
              evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using an all zero ciphertext
              value as input.
              <p></p>
              <b>Test 1c:</b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the two sets of key values
              described below and obtain the ciphertext values that result from AES encryption of an
              all zeros plaintext using the given key values and an IV of all zeros.  The first set of
              keys shall have 128 128-bit keys, and the second shall have 256 256-bit keys.  Key_i in
              each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i bits be zeros,
              for i in [1, N]. To test the decrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the two
              sets of key and ciphertext value pairs described below and obtain the plaintext value
              that results from decryption of the given ciphertext using the given key values and an
              IV of all zeros.  The first set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 128 128-bit
              key/ciphertext pairs, and the second set of key/ciphertext pairs shall have 256 256-bit
              pairs. Key_i in each set shall have the leftmost i bits be ones and the rightmost N-i
              bits be zeros for i in [1, N].  The ciphertext value in each pair shall be the value 
              that results in an all zeros plaintext when decrypted with its corresponding key.
              <p></p>
              <b>Test 1d:</b> To test the encrypt functionality, the evaluator shall supply the set of
              128 plaintext values described below and obtain the two ciphertext values that
              result from encryption of the given plaintext using a 128-bit key value of all
              zeros and using a 256 bit key value of all zeros, respectively, and an IV of all
              zeros. Plaintext value i in each set shall have the leftmost bits be ones and
              the rightmost 128-i bits be zeros, for i in [1, 128].  To test the decrypt functionality,
              the evaluator shall perform the same test as for encrypt, using ciphertext
              values of the same form as the plaintext in the encrypt test as input.
              <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
<b>Test 2: </b>
              Multi-Block Message Test
              <p></p>
              The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality by encrypting an i-block 
              message where 1 less-than i less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator 
              shall choose a key, IV, and plaintext message of length i blocks and encrypt
              the message, using the mode to be tested, with the chosen key. The ciphertext
              shall be compared to the result of encrypting the same plaintext message with
              the same key and IV using a known good implementation. The evaluator shall also 
              test the decrypt functionality by decrypting an i-block message where 1 less-than
              i less-than-or-equal to 10. For each i the evaluator shall choose a key and
              a ciphertext message of length i blocks and decrypt the message, using the mode 
              to be tested, with the chosen key. The plaintext shall be compared to the result
              of decrypting the same ciphertext message with the same key using a known good implementation.
              <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
<b>Test 3: </b>
              Monte-Carlo Test
              <p></p>
              For AES-CTR mode perform the Monte Carlo Test for ECB Mode on the encryption 
              engine of the counter mode implementation. There is no need to test the decryption engine.
              <p></p>
              The evaluator shall test the encrypt functionality using 200 plaintext/key pairs. 
              100 of these shall use 128 bit keys, and 100 of these shall use 256 bit keys.  
              The plaintext values shall be 128-bit blocks.  For each pair, 1000 iterations shall be run as follows:
              <p></p>
              For AES-ECB mode<br>
              # Input: PT, Key<br>
              for i = 1 to 1000:<br>
              CT[i] = AES-ECB-Encrypt(Key, PT)<br>
              PT = CT[i]
              <p></p>
              The ciphertext computed in the 1000th iteration is the result for that 
              trial.  This result shall be compared to the result of running 1000 
              iterations with the same values using a known good implementation.  
            </li>
          </ul>
            If "invoke platform-provided" is selected, the evaluator confirms that SSH connections are only successful if appropriate algorithms and appropriate key sizes are configured. To do this, the evaluator shall perform the following tests:
            <ul xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
              <li>
<b>Test 1: </b>
                [Conditional: TOE is an SSH server] The evaluator shall configure an SSH client to connect with an invalid cryptographic algorithm and key size for each listening SSH socket connection on the TOE.  
                The evaluator initiates SSH client connections to each listening SSH socket connection on the TOE and observes that the connection fails in each attempt.
