                (including enabling or disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the TOE that are
                necessary to enforce the requirements specified in the PP. The evaluator shall
                document the methodology or approach taken while determining which actions in the
                administrative guide are security relevant with respect to this PP. The evaluator

                by having the TOE generate audit records for the events listed in the provided table
                and administrative actions. This should include all instances of an event. The
                evaluator shall test that audit records are generated for the establishment and
                termination of a channel for each of the cryptographic protocols contained in the
                ST. For administrative actions, the evaluator shall test that each action determined
                by the evaluator above to be security relevant in the context of this PP is
                auditable. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure the audit
                records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative
                guide, and that the fields specified in FAU_GEN.1.2 are contained in each audit
                record. <br/><br/> Note that the testing here can be accomplished in
                conjunction with the testing of the security mechanisms directly. For example,
                testing performed to ensure that the administrative guidance provided is correct
                verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the invocation of the

                <br/><br/> The Function test verifies the ability of the TOE to implement
                the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this test the evaluator shall
                generate or obtain test vectors from a known good implementation of the TOE
                supported schemes. For each supported key agreement scheme-key agreement role
                combination, KDF type, and, if supported, key confirmation role- key confirmation
                type combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. The data set
                consists of one set of domain parameter values (FFC) or the NIST approved curve
                (ECC) per 10 sets of public keys. These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending
                on the scheme being tested. <br/><br/> The evaluator shall obtain the DKM,
                the corresponding TOE’s public keys (static and/or ephemeral), the MAC tag(s), and
                any inputs used in the KDF, such as the Other Information field OI and TOE id
                fields. <br/><br/> If the TOE does not use a KDF defined in SP 800-56A
                Revision 3, the evaluator shall obtain only the public keys and the hashed value of
                the shared secret. <br/><br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of
                the TSF’s implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to
                calculate the shared secret value, derive the keying material DKM, and compare
                hashes or MAC tags generated from these values.<br/><br/> If key
                confirmation is supported, the TSF shall perform the above for each implemented
                approved MAC algorithm. <br/><br/>
                <i><b>Validity Test</b></i>
                <br/><br/> The Validity test verifies the ability of the TOE to recognize
                another party’s valid and invalid key agreement results with or without key
                confirmation. To conduct this test, the evaluator shall obtain a list of the
                supporting cryptographic functions included in the SP800-56A Revision 3 key
                agreement implementation to determine which errors the TOE should be able to
                recognize. The evaluator generates a set of 24 (FFC) or 30 (ECC) test vectors
                consisting of data sets including domain parameter values or NIST approved curves,
                the evaluator’s public keys, the TOE’s public/private key pairs, MACTag, and any
                inputs used in the KDF, such as the other info and TOE id fields. <br/><br/>
                The evaluator shall inject an error in some of the test vectors to test that the TOE
                recognizes invalid key agreement results caused by the following fields being
                incorrect: the shared secret value Z, the DKM, the other information field OI, the
                data to be MACed, or the generated MACTag. If the TOE contains the full or partial
                (only ECC) public key validation, the evaluator will also individually inject errors
                in both parties’ static public keys, both parties’ ephemeral public keys and the
                TOE’s static private key to assure the TOE detects errors in the public key
                validation function and/or the partial key validation function (in ECC only). At
                least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and therefore should result in
                valid key agreement results (they should pass). <br/><br/> The TOE shall use
                these modified test vectors to emulate the key agreement scheme using the
                corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the TOE’s results with the
                results using a known good implementation verifying that the TOE detects these
                errors. <br/><br/>
                <h3>SP800-56B Key Establishment Schemes</h3> The evaluator shall verify that
                the TSS describes whether the TOE acts as a sender, a recipient, or both for
                RSA-based key establishment schemes. <br/><br/> If the TOE acts as a sender,
                the following assurance activity shall be performed to ensure the proper operation
                of every TOE supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <br/>
                To conduct this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with or without key confirmation
                if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key confirmation
                is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if KTS-OAEP is
                supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test vector
                shall include the RSA public key, the plaintext keying material, any additional
                input parameters if applicable, the MacKey and MacTag if key confirmation is
                incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector, the evaluator
                shall perform a key establishment encryption operation on the TOE with the same
                inputs (in cases where key confirmation is incorporated, the test shall use the
                MacKey from the test vector instead of the randomly generated MacKey used in normal
                operation) and ensure that the outputted ciphertext is equivalent to the ciphertext
                in the test vector. <br/><br/> If the TOE acts as a receiver, the following
                assurance activities shall be performed to ensure the proper operation of every TOE
                supported combination of RSA-based key establishment scheme: <br/> To conduct
                this test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors FCS_CKM.2.1/LOCKED from a
                known good implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each combination of
                supported key establishment scheme and its options (with our without key
                confirmation if supported, for each supported key confirmation MAC function if key
                confirmation is supported, and for each supported mask generation function if
                KTS-OAEP is supported), the tester shall generate 10 sets of test vectors. Each test
                vector shall include the RSA private key, the plaintext keying material (KeyData),
                any additional input parameters if applicable, the MacTag in cases where key
                confirmation is incorporated, and the outputted ciphertext. For each test vector,
                the evaluator shall perform the key establishment decryption operation on the TOE
                and ensure that the outputted plaintext keying material (KeyData) is equivalent to
                the plaintext keying material in the test vector. In cases where key confirmation is
                incorporated, the evaluator shall perform the key confirmation steps and ensure that
                the outputted MacTag is equivalent to the MacTag in the test vector.
                <br/><br/> The evaluator shall ensure that the TSS describes how the TOE
                handles decryption errors. In accordance with NIST Special Publication 800-56B, the
                TOE must not reveal the particular error that occurred, either through the contents
                of any outputted or logged error message or through timing variations. If KTS-OAEP
                is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived ciphertext values that
                trigger each of the three decryption error checks described in NIST Special
                Publication 800-56B section 7.2.2.3, ensure that each decryption attempt results in
                an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message is identical for
                each. If KTS-KEMKWS is supported, the evaluator shall create separate contrived
                ciphertext values that trigger each of the three decryption error checks described
                in NIST Special Publication 800-56B section 7.2.3.3, ensure that each decryption
                attempt results in an error, and ensure that any outputted or logged error message
                is identical for each.<br/><br/>
                <h3>RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 Key Establishment Schemes</h3> The evaluator shall
                verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5 by using a
                known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_ITC_EXT.1 that uses
                RSAES-PKCS1-v1_5. <h3>Diffie-Hellman Group 14</h3> The evaluator shall
                verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of Diffie-Hellman group 14 by
                using a known good implementation for each protocol selected in FTP_ITC_EXT.1 that
                uses Diffie-Hellman Group 14. <h3>FFC Schemes using "safe-prime" groups</h3>
                The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF's implementation of
                "safe-prime" groups by using a known good implementation for each protocol selected
                in FTP_ITC_EXT.1 that uses "safe-prime" groups. This test must be performed for each
                "safe-prime" group that each protocol uses.

                <b>Curve25519 Key Establishment Schemes</b><br/><br/> The evaluator
                shall verify a TOE's implementation of the key agreement scheme using the following
                Function and Validity tests. These validation tests for each key agreement scheme
                verify that a TOE has implemented the components of the key agreement scheme
                according to the specification. These components include the calculation of the
                shared secret K and the hash of K. <br/><br/>
                <b>Function Test</b><br/><br/> The Function test verifies the
                ability of the TOE to implement the key agreement schemes correctly. To conduct this
                test the evaluator shall generate or obtain test vectors from a known good
                implementation of the TOE supported schemes. For each supported key agreement role
                and hash function combination, the tester shall generate 10 sets of public keys.
                These keys are static, ephemeral or both depending on the scheme being tested.
                <br/><br/> The evaluator shall obtain the shared secret value K, and the
                hash of K.<br/><br/> The evaluator shall verify the correctness of the TSF’s
                implementation of a given scheme by using a known good implementation to calculate
                the shared secret value K and compare the hash generated from this value. <br/><br/>
                <b> Validity Test</b><br/><br/> The Validity test verifies the
                ability of the TOE to recognize another party’s valid and invalid key agreement
                results. To conduct this test, the evaluator generates a set of 30 test vectors
                consisting of data sets including the evaluator’s public keys and the TOE’s
                public/private key pairs. <br/><br/> The evaluator shall inject an error in
                some of the test vectors to test that the TOE recognizes invalid key agreement
                results caused by the following fields being incorrect: the shared secret value K or
                the hash of K. At least two of the test vectors shall remain unmodified and
                therefore should result in valid key agreement results (they should pass).
                <br/><br/> The TOE shall use these modified test vectors to emulate the key
                agreement scheme using the corresponding parameters. The evaluator shall compare the

              the selection appropriate for the device. A DEK is used in addition to the KEK so that

              If a BAF is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1 the enrollment or authentication templates are not
              subject to this requirement, since templates are not suitable for deriving keying

              are examples of critical security parameters that must be destroyed when no longer
              needed. <br/><br/> Key destruction procedures are performed in accordance with
              FCS_CKM_EXT.4.1. <br/><br/> There are multiple situations in which plaintext
              keying material is no longer necessary, including when the TOE is powered off, when
              the wipe function is performed, when trusted channels are disconnected, when keying

              Authentication Factor or that key material which is protected by the password-derived
              or biometric-unlocked KEK according to FCS_STG_EXT.2 – see ).
              For keys (or key material used to derive those keys) protecting sensitive data

              Bluetooth BR/EDR, and Bluetooth LE. The plaintext keying material for these channels
              includes (but is not limited to) master secrets, and Security Associations (SAs).
              <br/><br/> If REK(s) are processed in a separate execution environment on the
              same Application Processor as the Rich OS, REK key material must be cleared from RAM

              is no longer allowed, and SHA-1 for verification of digital signatures is strongly
              discouraged as there may be risk in accepting these signatures. It is expected that
              vendors will implement SHA-2 algorithms in accordance with SP
              800-131A.<br/><br/> SHA-1 is currently required in order to comply with the
              WLAN Client Extended Package. Vendors are strongly encouraged to implement updated
              protocols that support the SHA-2 family; until updated protocols are supported, this
              PP allows support for SHA-1 implementations in compliance with SP
              800-131A.<br/><br/> The intent of this requirement is to specify the hashing
              function. The hash selection must support the message digest size selection. The hash
              selection should be consistent with the overall strength of the algorithm used (for
              example, SHA 256 for 128-bit keys). <br/><br/> The TSF hashing functions can
              be implemented in one of two modes. The first mode is the byte­oriented mode. In this
              mode the TSF only hashes messages that are an integral number of bytes in length; i.e.
              the length (in bits) of the message to be hashed is divisible by 8. The second mode is
              the bit­oriented mode. In this mode the TSF hashes messages of arbitrary length. The
              TSF may implement either bit-oriented or byte-oriented; both implementations are not

              (hash functions/ciphers). The ST author will select the function used, and include the
              specific underlying cryptographic primitives used in the requirement or in the TSS.
              While any of the identified hash functions (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512) are
              allowed for Hash_DRBG or HMAC_DRBG, only AES-based implementations for CTR_DRBG are
              allowed. <br/><br/> The ST author must also ensure that any underlying
              functions are included in the baseline requirements for the TOE. <br/><br/>
              Health testing of the DRBGs is performed in conjunction with the self-tests required
              in FPT_TST_EXT.1.1. <br/><br/> For the selection in FCS_RBG_EXT.1.2, the ST
              author selects the appropriate number of bits of entropy that corresponds to the
              greatest security strength of the algorithms included in the ST. Security strength is
              defined in Tables 2 and 3 of NIST SP 800-57A. For example, if the implementation
              includes 2048-bit RSA (security strength of 112 bits), AES 128 (security strength 128
              bits), and HMAC-SHA-256 (security strength 256 bits), then the ST author would select
              256 bits. <br/><br/> The ST author may select either software or hardware
              noise sources. A hardware noise source is a component that produces data that cannot
              be explained by a deterministic rule, due to its physical nature. In other words, a
              hardware based noise source generates sequences of random numbers from a physical
              process that cannot be predicted. For example, a sampled ring oscillator consists of
              an odd number of inverter gates chained into a loop, with an electrical pulse
              traveling from inverter to inverter around the loop. The inverters are not clocked, so
              the precise time required for a complete circuit around the loop varies slightly as
              various physical effects modify the small delay time at each inverter on the line to
              the next inverter. This variance results in an approximate natural frequency that
              contains drift and jitter over time. The output of the ring oscillator consists of the
              oscillating binary value sampled at a constant rate from one of the inverters – a rate
              that is significantly slower than the oscillator’s natural frequency. </span></div></td>

              For each of the listed FCS components in the bulleted list, the intent is that the TOE will make available all algorithms specified for that component in the ST. For example, if for FCS_COP.1/HASH the ST author selects SHA-256, then the TOE would have to make available an interface to perform SHA-1 (the "mandatory" portion of FCS_COP.1/HASH) and SHA-256 (the "selected" portion of FCS_COP.1/HASH).<br/><br/> 
              The exception is for FCS_COP.1/ENCRYPT. The TOE is not required to make available AES_CCMP, AES_XTS, AES_GCMP-256, or AES_CCMP_256 even though they may be implemented to perform TSF-related functions. It is acceptable for the platform to not provide AES Key Wrap (KW) and AES Key Wrap with Padding (KWP) to applications even if selected in FCS_COP.1/ENCRYPT.  However, the ST author is expected to select AES-GCM and/or AES-CCM if it is selected in the ST for the FCS_COP.1/ENCRYPT component.

              likelihood that the biometric will incorrectly accept an authentication attempt by an
              unauthorized user. A system's FAR typically is stated as the proportion of
              verification transactions with wrongful claims of identity that are incorrectly
              confirmed. <br/><br/> The False Reject Rate (FRR) is the measure of the
              likelihood that the biometric security system will incorrectly reject an

              authentication, multiple authentication attempts for a BAF that is claimed to have a
              one-attempt FAR between 1:100 and 1:500 inclusive will not produce an acceptable SAFAR
              in meeting FIA_BMG_EXT.1.2. More generally, depending on the number of authentication
              attempts allowed for the BAF, the claimed FAR must be strong (or equivalently, low)
              enough so that the SAFAR chosen in FIA_BMG_EXT.1.2 can be met within the 1% margin
              mandated. <br/><br/> Generally testing environments for a biometric system in
              a mobile device are based on a single legitimate user enrolling and test subjects
              attempt to authenticate. Since a thorough evaluation for FAR and FRR meeting all the
              conditions of statistical independence is not feasible in the timeframe of CC
              evaluations and in agreement with ISO/IEC 19795, the use of offline testing is
              acceptable even if this causes the biometric system to deviate slightly from the
              evaluated configuration. Additionally, full cross-comparison (i.e. all test subjects
              are compared to non-self) is acceptable. <br/><br/> Detailed explanations

              False Accept Rate (SAFAR) is defined by the combination of individual error rates for
              each authentication factor and attempts used for access to a single session on the
              device. <br/><br/> Accessing a single session may involve a single
              authentication factor, in which case the SAFAR for a single attempt will be equal to
              the false accept rate (FAR) of that authentication factor and the SAFAR for n attempts
              will be $1-\left(1-FAR\right)^n$, assuming independence. <br/><br/> Accessing
              a single session on the device may involve the ability to use multiple authentication
              factors. It may be the case that only one authentication factor is needed to access a
              single session on the device (i.e. both a password and a BAF can be used, but only one
              is needed) or that both authentication factors are needed to access a single session
              on the device (i.e. both the BAF and a PIN must be entered). The full equations for
              calculating the SAFAR can be found in . A fully
              worked-out example that applies the equations in  for
              calculating the SAFAR can be found in .
              <br/><br/> The worst-case scenario shall be used to calculate the SAFAR. Thus
              the authentication factor with the highest FAR shall be used for the maximum number of
              authentication attempts allowed for that factor. If any authentication attempts
              remain, then the authentication factor with the second highest FAR is used for the
              maximum number of authentication attempts allowed for that factor and so on. For
              example, the TOE supports a password and a BAF, the FAR for the BAF is higher than the
              FAR for the password and each authentication factor utilizes a shared counter per
              FIA_AFL_EXT.1. Then the worst-case scenario is the BAF is utilized for the maximum
              number of authentication attempts allowed for the BAF. For any remaining
              authentication attempts allowed the password is utilized. <br/><br/> Another
              example is the TOE supports a password and two BAFs, where the BAFs have different
              FARs, with both FARs being higher than the password FAR. Then the worst-case scenario
              is that the BAF with the highest FAR is used for the maximum number of authentication
              attempts allowed for that BAF, followed by the second BAF if any authentication
              attempts are allowed for that BAF. If any authentication attempts remain, then the
              password is utilized for those attempts. <br/><br/> The 1% margin is included
              for cases where a BAF is not a critical authentication factor and thus both BAF and
              password can be used in a session without exceeding the declared SAFAR.

                the assurance activity for this requirement. Henniger, Scheuermann, and Kniess <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#IBPC">[IBPC]</a>, provide a description of attack potential calculation with
                examples. Until such time as ISO 19989 is published, the vendor shall provide to the
                lab a description of the PAD processing implemented in the TSF, test procedures used
                to validate successful operation of PAD, and test data with results of the PAD
                validation testing. The lab may analyze the test procedures and data to validate
                vendor test results or, optionally, may conduct its own testing. <br/><br/>
              
               If the lab performs its own testing, it is highly recommended that the vendor
                provides spoof testing tools, as it is not expected for the lab to create a test
                procedure for modalities outside of established standards and easily implemented
                procedures. Labs can also expedite the testing process by purchasing the appropriate
                spoof kits and recipes from specialized biometrics testing labs.

              sub-functions in an optional function, all sub-functions outside the selection must be
              implemented in order for the function to be listed. </span></div></td>

               compares the management functions required by this
              Protection Profile. <br/><br/> The first column lists the management functions
              identified in the PP. <br/><br/> In the following columns: <ul>
                <li>‘M’ means Mandatory</li>
                <li>‘O’ means Optional/Objective</li>
              </ul>
              <br/><br/> The second column (FMT_SMF_EXT.1) indicates whether the function is
              to be implemented. The ST author should select which Optional functions are
              implemented. <br/><br/> The third column (FMT_MOF_EXT.1.1) indicates functions
              that are to be restricted to the user (i.e. not available to the administrator).
              <br/><br/> The fourth column (Administrator) indicates functions that are
              available to the administrator. The functions restricted to the user (column 3) cannot
              also be available to the administrator. Functions available to the administrator can
              still be available to the user, as long as the function is not restricted to the
              administrator (column 5). Thus, if the TOE must offer these functions to the
              administrator to perform the fourth column shall be selected. <br/><br/> The
              fifth column (FMT_MOF_EXT.1.2) indicates whether the function is to be restricted to
              the administrator when the device is enrolled and the administrator applies the
              indicated policy. If the function is restricted to the administrator the function is
              not available to the user. This does not prevent the user from modifying a setting to
              make the function stricter, but the user cannot undo the configuration enforced by the
              administrator. <br/><br/> The ST author may use a table in the ST, listing
              only those functions that are implemented. For functions that are mandatory, any
              sub-functions not in a selection are also mandatory and any assignments must contain
              at least one assigned value. For functions that are optional and contain an assignment
              or selection, at least one value must be assigned/selected to be included in the ST.
              For non-selectable sub-functions in an optional function, all sub-functions must be
              implemented in order for the function to be included. For functions with a "per-app
              basis" sub function and an assignment, the ST author must indicate which assigned
              features are manageable on a per-app basis and which are not by iterating the row. <br/><br/>
              <b>Function-specific Application Notes:</b><br/><br/> For functions
                ,  and , the function must be implemented on a device-wide basis but may also be
              implemented on a per-app basis or on a per-group of applications basis in which the
              configuration includes the list of applications or groups of applications to which the
              enable/disable applies. <br/><br/> Function  addresses
              enabling and disabling the IPsec VPN only. The configuration of the VPN Client itself
              (with information such as VPN Gateway, certificates, and algorithms) is addressed by
              the PP-Module for VPN Client. The administrator options should only be listed if the
              administrator can remotely enable/disable the VPN connection. <br/><br/>
              Function  optionally allows the VPN to be configured per-app or
              per-groups of apps. If this configuration is selected, it does not void FDP_IFC_EXT.1.
              Instead FDP_IFC_EXT.1 is applied to the application or group of applications the VPN
              is applied to. In other words, all traffic destined for the VPN-enabled application or
              group of applications, must travel through the VPN, but traffic not destined for that
              application or group of applications can travel outside the VPN. When the VPN is
              configured across the device FDP_IFC_EXT.1 applies to all traffic and the VPN must not
              split tunnel. <br/><br/> The assignment in function 
              consists of all radios present on the TSF, such as Wi-Fi, GPS, cellular, NFC,
              Bluetooth BR/EDR, and Bluetooth LE, which can be enabled and disabled. In the future,
              if both Bluetooth BR/EDR and Bluetooth LE are supported, they will be required to be
              enabled and disabled separately. Disablement of the cellular radio does not imply that
              the radio may not be enabled in order to place emergency phone calls; however, it is
              not expected that a device in "airplane mode", where all radios are disabled, will
              automatically (without authorization) turn on the cellular radio to place emergency
              calls. <br/><br/> The assignment in function 
              consists of at least one audio and/or visual device, such as camera and microphone,
              which can be enabled and disabled by either the user or administrator. Disablement of
              the microphone does not imply that the microphone may not be enabled in order to place
              emergency phone calls. If certain devices are able to be restricted to the enterprise
              (either device-wide, per-app or per-group of applications) and others are able to be
              restricted to users, then this function should be iterated in the table with the
              appropriate table entries. <br/><br/> Regarding functions  and , disablement of a particular
              radio or audio/visual device must be effective as soon as the TOE has power.
              Disablement must also apply when the TOE is booted into auxiliary boot modes, for
              example, associated with updates or backup. If the TOE supports states in which
              security management policy is inaccessible, for example, due to data-at-rest
              protection, it is acceptable to meet this requirement by ensuring that these devices
              are disabled by default while in these states. That these devices are disabled during
              auxiliary boot modes does not imply that the device (particularly the cellular radio)
              may not be enabled in order to perform emergency phone calls. <br/><br/> Wipe
              of the TSF (function ) is performed according to FCS_CKM_EXT.5.
              Protected data is all non-TSF data, including all user or enterprise data. Some or all
              of this data may be considered sensitive data as well. <br/><br/> The
              selection in function  allows the ST author to
              select which mechanisms are available to the administrator through the MDM Agent to
              restrict the applications which the user may install. The ST author shall state if
              application whitelisting is applied device-wide or if it can be specified to apply to
              either the Enterprise and/or Personal applications. <ul>
                <li>If the administrator can restrict the sources from which applications can be
                  installed, the ST author selects option a. </li>
                <li>If the administrator can specify a whitelist of allowed applications, the ST
                  author selects option b. The ST author should list any application characteristics
                  (e.g. name, version, or developer) based on which the whitelist can be
                  formed.</li>
                <li>If the administrator can prevent the user from installing additional
                  applications, the ST author selects c. </li>
              </ul>
              <br/><br/> In the future, function  may require
              destruction or disabling of any default trusted CA certificates, excepting those CA
              certificates necessary for continued operation of the TSF, such as the developer’s
              certificate. At this time, the ST author shall indicate in the assignment whether
              pre-installed or any other category of X.509v3 certificates may be removed from the
              Trust Anchor Database. <br/><br/> For function , the
              enrollment function may be installing an MDM agent and includes the policies to be
              applied to the device. It is acceptable for the user approval notice to require the
              user to intentionally opt to view the policies (for example, by "tapping" on a "View"
              icon) rather than listing the policies in full in the notice. <br/><br/> For
              function , the administrator capability to update the system
              software may be limited to causing a prompt to the user to update rather than the
              ability to initiate the update itself. As the administrator is likely to be acting
              remotely, he/she would be unaware of inopportune situations, such as low power, which
              may cause the update to fail and the device to become inoperable. The user can refuse
              to accept the update in such situations. It is expected that system architects will be
              cognizant of this limitation and will enforce network access controls in order to
              enforce enterprise-critical updates. <br/><br/> Function  addresses both installation and update. This protection profile
              does not distinguish between installation and update of applications because mobile
              devices typically completely overwrite the previous installation with a new
              installation during an application update. <br/><br/> For function , "Enterprise applications" are those applications that belong
              to the Enterprise application group. Applications installed by the enterprise
              administrator (including automatic installation by the administrator after being
              requested by the user from a catalog of enterprise applications) are by default placed
              in the Enterprise application group unless an exception has been made in function
                 of FMT_SMF_EXT.1.1. <br/><br/> If the display
              of notifications in the locked state is supported, the configuration of these
              notifications (function ) must be included in the
              selection. <br/><br/> Function  must be included in the
              selection if data-at-rest protection is not natively enabled. <br/><br/>
              Function  is implicitly met if the TSF does not support
              removable media. <br/><br/> For function , location
              services include location information gathered from GPS, cellular, and Wi-Fi.
              <br/><br/> Function  is implicitly met if the
              TOE does not contain a BAF. This selection shall correspond with the selection made in
              FIA_UAU.5.1. If a BAF is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, "Biometric Authentication Factor"
              shall be selected and the user or admin shall have the option to disable the use of
              it. If multiple BAFs are selected in FIA_UAU.5.1, this applies to all different
              modalities. If "hybrid" is selected in FIA_UAU.5.1 it shall be selected and the user
              or admin shall have the option to disable the use of it. <br/><br/>
              
              For function , the configuration can be different
              depending on the specific trusted channel. <br/><br/>
               The assignment in function
                 consists of all externally accessible hardware
              ports, such as USB, the SD card, and HDMI, whose data transfer capabilities can be
              enabled and disabled by either the user or administrator. Disablement of data transfer
              over an external port must be effective during and after boot into the normal
              operative mode of the device. If the TOE supports states in which configured security
              management policy is inaccessible, for example, due to data-at-rest protection, it is
              acceptable to meet this requirement by ensuring that data transfer is disabled by
              default while in these states. Each of the ports may be enabled or disabled
              separately. The configuration policy need not disable all ports together. In the case
              of USB, chagrining is still allowed if data transfer capabilities have been disabled.
              <br/><br/> The assignment in function 
              consists of all protocols where the TSF acts as a server, which can be enabled and
              disabled by either the user or administrator. <br/><br/> Function  must be included in the selection if developer modes are
              supported by the TSF. <br/><br/> Function  must
              be included in the selection if bypass of local user authentication, such as a "Forgot
              Password", password hint, or remote authentication feature, is supported.
              <br/><br/> Function  must be included in the
              selection if the TSF allows applications, other than the MDM Agents, to import or
              remove X.509v3 certificates from the Trust Anchor Database. The MDM Agent is
              considered the administrator. This function does not apply to applications trusting a
              certificate for its own validations. The function only applies to situations where the
              application modifies the device-wide Trust Anchor Database, affecting the validations
              performed by the TSF for other applications. The user or administrator may be provided
              the ability to globally allow or deny any application requests in order to meet this
              requirement. <br/><br/> Function  must be
              included in the ST if "administrator-configured option" is selection in
              FIA_X509_EXT.2.2. <br/><br/> Function  should be
              included in the selection if FPT_TUD_EXT.4.1 is included in the ST and the
              configurable option is selected. <br/><br/> Function  should be included in the selection if user or administrator is
              selected in FCS_STG_EXT.1.4. <br/><br/> Function  should be included in the selection if user or administrator is selected in
              FCS_STG_EXT.1.5. <br/><br/> Function  must be
              included in the selection if FTA_TAB.1 is included in the ST. <br/><br/>
              Function  must be included in the selection if FAU_SEL.1
              is included in the ST. <br/><br/> For function ,
              hotspot functionality refers to the condition in which the mobile device is serving as
              an access point to other devices, not the connection of the TOE to external hotspots.
              <br/><br/> Functions  and  correspond to FDP_ACF_EXT.1.2. <br/><br/> For function
                , FMT_SMF_EXT.2.1 specifies actions to be performed when
              the TOE is unenrolled from management. <br/><br/> For function , shall be included in the ST if IPsec is selected in
              FTP_ITC_EXT.1 and the native IPsec VPN client can be configured to be Always-On.
              Always-On is defined as when the TOE has a network connection the VPN attempts to
              connect, all data leaving the device uses the VPN when the VPN is connected and no
              data leaves that device when the VPN is disconnected. The configuration of the VPN
              Client itself (with information such as VPN Gateway, certificates, and algorithms) is
              addressed by the PP-Module for VPN Client. </span></div></td>

              The evaluator shall verify that the TSS describes all management functions, what

        <td>The evaluator shall prepare a test plan and report documenting the testing
              aspects of the system. The test plan covers all of the testing actions contained in
              the <a xmlns:htm="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="#CEM">[CEM]</a> and the body of this PP’s Assurance Activities. While it is
              not necessary to have one test case per test listed in an Assurance Activity, the
              evaluator must document in the test plan that each applicable testing requirement in
              the ST is covered. <br/><br/> The test plan identifies the platforms to be
              tested, and for those platforms not included in the test plan but included in the ST,
              the test plan provides a justification for not testing the platforms. This
              justification must address the differences between the tested platforms and the
              untested platforms, and make an argument that the differences do not affect the
              testing to be performed. It is not sufficient to merely assert that the differences
              have no affect; rationale must be provided. If all platforms claimed in the ST are
              tested, then no rationale is necessary. <br/><br/> The test plan describes the
              composition of each platform to be tested, and any setup that is necessary beyond what
              is contained in the AGD documentation. It should be noted that the evaluator is
              expected to follow the AGD documentation for installation and setup of each platform
              either as part of a test or as a standard pre-test condition. This may include special
              test drivers or tools. For each driver or tool, an argument (not just an assertion)
              should be provided that the driver or tool will not adversely affect the performance
              of the functionality by the TOE and its platform. This also includes the configuration
              of the cryptographic engine to be used. The cryptographic algorithms implemented by
              this engine are those specified by this PP and used by the cryptographic protocols
              being evaluated (IPsec, TLS/HTTPS, SSH). <br/><br/> The test plan identifies
              high-level test objectives as well as the test procedures to be followed to achieve
              those objectives. These procedures include expected results. The test report (which
              could just be an annotated version of the test plan) details the activities that took
              place when the test procedures were executed, and includes the actual results of the
              tests. This shall be a cumulative account, so if there was a test run that resulted in
              a failure; a fix installed; and then a successful re-run of the test, the report would
              show a "fail" and "pass" result (and the supporting details), and not just the "pass"
              result.</td>

              public information to find vulnerabilities that have been found in mobile devices and
              the implemented communication protocols in general, as well as those that pertain to
              the particular TOE. The evaluator documents the sources consulted and the
              vulnerabilities found in the report. <br/><br/> For each vulnerability found,
              the evaluator either provides a rationale with respect to its non-applicability, or
              the evaluator formulates a test (using the guidelines provided in ATE_IND) to confirm
              the vulnerability, if suitable. Suitability is determined by assessing the attack
              vector needed to take advantage of the vulnerability. If exploiting the vulnerability
              requires expert skills and an electron microscope, for instance, then a test would not
              be suitable and an appropriate justification would be formulated.</td>
