    <h2 class='indexable' data-level='2' id='TOEdescription'>1.3 Compliant Targets of Evaluation</h2>
     
     This document specifies SFRs for a WLAN Client. The TOE defined
     by this <a class='abbr' href='#abbr_PP-Module'><abbr title='Protection Profile Module'>PP-Module</abbr></a> is the WLAN Client, a component executing on a client machine (often referred to as
     a "remote access client"). The TOE establishes a secure wireless tunnel between the client
     device and a WLAN Access System through which all data will traverse.
     <p></p>
      A WLAN Client allows remote users to use client machines to establish wireless communication
      with a private network through a WLAN Access System. IP packets passing between the
      private network and a WLAN Client are encrypted. The WLAN Client protects the confidentiality and integrity of
      data in transit between itself and the private network, even though it traverses a wireless connection.
      The focus of the SFRs in this <a class='abbr' href='#abbr_PP-Module'><abbr title='Protection Profile Module'>PP-Module</abbr></a> is on the following fundamental
      aspects of a WLAN Client:
      <ul>
        <li>Authentication of the WLAN Client</li>
        <li>Authentication of the Authentication Server</li>
        <li>Cryptographic protection of data in transit</li>
        
        
        <li>Implementation of services</li>
        
      </ul>
      The WLAN Client establishes an 802.11 tunnel between the client device and the network
      infrastructure using IEEE 802.1X with Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security (EAP-TLS) for authentication. It performs mutual
      authentication to an AS in the private network as part of the EAP-TLS exchange. The EAP-TLS
      exchange uses certificates for mutual authentication. The WLAN Client examines the machine
      certificate transmitted from the AS, checks its validity, and ensures the certificate is signed by a
      trusted Certificate Authority (CA). The AS will authenticate the WLAN Client certificate at the
      same time. When the EAP-TLS exchange completes successfully, the network allows the WLAN
      Client to finish establishing a secure communication tunnel to the private network. The WLAN
      Client sets up an encrypted, authenticated channel to the WLAN Access System using a 4-way
      handshake, as specified in IEEE 802.11. Once the channel is established, all communication
      between the WLAN Client to the WLAN Access System is encrypted with Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 
      Cipher Block Chaining-Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) mode and
      optionally AES in Galois/Counter Mode Protocol (GCMP) mode, as specified in <a href='#bib80211'>[802.11-2016]</a>.
      
      <h3 class='indexable' data-level='3' id='TOEboundary'>1.3.1 TOE Boundary</h3>
        The WLAN Client (Figure 1), as defined by this <a class='abbr' href='#abbr_PP-Module'><abbr title='Protection Profile Module'>PP-Module</abbr></a>, is a component executing on a remote access
        client machine. Note the client is depicted as just a small portion of the WLAN client "machine."
        As such, the TOE must rely heavily on the TOE’s operational environment (host platform,
        network stack, and operating system) for its execution domain and its proper usage. The TOE
        will rely on the IT environment to address much of the security functionality related to
        administrative functions.

    This PP-Module is written to address the situation when an entity desires wireless access to a private
    network. To allow access to the private network, the entity (machine) must be authenticated
    before a secure communications channel can be established. The TOE is the entity that seeks to
    be authenticated and be given access to services offered by the protected network and is the
    Supplicant in the IEEE 802.1X framework.
    
    <h2 class='indexable' data-level='2' id='threats'>3.1 Threats</h2> The following threats are specific to WLAN Clients, and represent an addition to those identified in the <a class='abbr' href='#abbr_Base-PP'><abbr title='Base Protection Profile'>Base-PP</abbr></a>s. 
      
      <dl><dt>T.TSF_FAILURE</dt><dd>Security mechanisms of the TOE generally build up from a primitive set of mechanisms (e.g.,
            memory management, privileged modes of process execution) to more complex sets of

      In a PP-Configuration that includes  GPOS PP, the TOE is expected to rely on some of the security functions implemented by the Operating System as a whole and evaluated against the GPOS PP.
The following sections describe any modifications that the ST author must make to the SFRs
defined in the GPOS PP in addition to what is mandated by section 5.3.
    <h2 class='indexable' data-level='3' id='modsfr-GPOS'>5.1.1

      The SFRs listed in this section are defined in the GPOS Protection Profile and relevant to the secure operation of the TOE.

              however that its scope is expanded to include keys and key material that are used by the TSF
              described by this PP-Module. This SFR has not been iterated because it is assumed that the key
              destruction function is at least partially implemented by the underlying platform as opposed to
              the WLAN Client itself. For the purposes of this requirement, it is sufficient for the TOE to invoke
              the correct underlying functions of the host to perform the zeroization—it does not imply that
              the TOE has to include a kernel-mode memory driver to ensure the data are zeroized.
              <p></p>
              Any security related information (such as keys, authentication data, and passwords) must be
              zeroized when no longer in use to prevent the disclosure or modification of security critical data.
              <p></p>
              The zeroization indicated above applies to each intermediate storage area for plaintext key or CSP
              (i.e., any storage, such as memory buffers, that is included in the path of such data) upon the
              transfer of the key or CSP to another location.
              <p></p>
              Additionally, although IEEE 802.11-2016 does not specify Pairwise Master Key (PMK) lifetimes (described in IEEE
              802.11-2016 Section 11.6.1.3) for WLAN Clients, these lifetimes should be limited, and the
              PMK Security Association (PMKSA) cleared, in such a way as to prevent continued use of the same PMK for more than 24
              hours. Thus, for PMKs, “when no longer needed” is after 24 hours.

                The evaluator shall check the operational guidance and ensure it lists all of the auditable
                events and provides a format for audit records. Each audit record format type must be
                covered, along with a brief description of each field. The evaluator shall check to make sure
                that every audit event type mandated by the PP-Module is described and that the description of the
                fields contains the information required in FAU_GEN.1.2/WLAN, and the additional information
                specified in the Auditable Events table.
                <p></p>
                The evaluator shall in particular ensure that the operational guidance is clear in relation to the
                contents for failed cryptographic events. In the Auditable Events table, information detailing the cryptographic
                mode of operation and a name or identifier for the object being encrypted is required. The
                evaluator shall ensure that name or identifier is sufficient to allow an administrator reviewing
                the audit log to determine the context of the cryptographic operation (for example,
                performed during a key negotiation exchange, performed when encrypting data for transit) as
                well as the non-TOE endpoint of the connection for cryptographic failures relating to
                communications with other IT systems.
                <p></p>
                The evaluator shall also make a determination of the administrative actions that are relevant
                in the context of this PP-Module. The TOE may contain functionality that is not evaluated in the
                context of this PP-Module because the functionality is not specified in an SFR. This functionality may
                have administrative aspects that are described in the operational guidance. Since such
                administrative actions will not be performed in an evaluated configuration of the TOE, the
                evaluator shall examine the operational guidance and make a determination of which
                administrative commands, including subcommands, scripts, and configuration files, are related
                to the configuration (including enabling or disabling) of the mechanisms implemented in the
                TOE that are necessary to enforce the requirements specified in the PP-Module, which thus form the
                set of “all administrative actions”. The evaluator may perform this activity as part of the
                activities associated with ensuring the AGD_OPE guidance satisfies the requirements.   
                <p></p> 
              
              <div class='eacategory'>Tests</div>
                The evaluator shall test the TOE’s ability to correctly generate audit records by having the TOE
                generate audit records in accordance with the assurance activities associated with the
                functional requirements in this PP-Module. When verifying the test results, the evaluator shall ensure
                the audit records generated during testing match the format specified in the administrative
                guide, and that the fields in each audit record have the proper entries.
                <p></p>               
                Note that the testing here can be accomplished in conjunction with the testing of the security
                mechanisms directly. For example, testing performed to ensure that the administrative
                guidance provided is correct verifies that AGD_OPE.1 is satisfied and should address the
                invocation of the administrative actions that are needed to verify the audit records are
                generated as expected.

                    The evaluator shall configure the access point so the cryptoperiod of the

                    point and maintain the connection for a length of time that is greater than the
                    configured cryptoperiod. The evaluator shall use a packet capture tool to determine
                    that after the configured cryptoperiod, a re-negotiation is initiated to establish a new

                    <p></p>
                    Step 1: The evaluator shall configure the access point to an unused channel and
                    configure the WLAN sniffer to sniff only on that channel (i.e., lock the sniffer on the
                    selected channel). The sniffer should also be configured to filter on the MAC address

                    point using IEEE 802.11-2016 and a 256-bit (64 hex values 0-f) pre-shared key. The

              <ul>
                <li><b>Test 1: </b>The evaluator shall establish a TLS connection using each of the cipher suites
                  specified by the requirement. This connection may be established as part of the
                  establishment of a higher-level protocol, e.g., as part of an EAP session. It is sufficient to
                  observe the successful negotiation of a cipher suite to satisfy the intent of the test; it is
                  not necessary to examine the characteristics of the encrypted traffic in an attempt to
                  discern the cipher suite being used (for example, that the cryptographic algorithm is 128-bit
                  AES and not 256-bit AES).
                </li>
                <li><b>Test 2: </b>
                  The evaluator shall attempt to establish the connection using a server with a
                  server certificate that contains the Server Authentication purpose in the
                  extendedKeyUsage field and verify that a connection is established. The evaluator will
                  then verify that the client rejects an otherwise valid server certificate that lacks the
                  Server Authentication purpose in the extendedKeyUsage field and a connection is not
                  established. Ideally, the two certificates should be identical except for the
                  extendedKeyUsage field.
                </li>
                <li><b>Test 3: </b>
                  The evaluator shall send a server certificate in the TLS connection that does not
                  match the server-selected cipher suite (for example, send a ECDSA certificate while using
                  the TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA cipher suite or send a RSA certificate while using
                  one of the ECDSA cipher suites.) The evaluator shall verify that the TOE disconnects after
                  receiving the server’s Certificate handshake message.
                </li>
                <li><b>Test 4: </b>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Change the TLS version selected by the server in the Server Hello to a nonsupported TLS version (for example 1.5 represented by the two bytes 03 06) and
                      verify that the client rejects the connection.</li>
                    <li>Modify at least one byte in the server’s nonce in the Server Hello handshake
                      message, and verify that the client rejects the Server Key Exchange handshake
                      message (if using a DHE or ECDHE cipher suite) or that the server denies the
                      client’s Finished handshake message.</li>
                    <li>Modify the server’s selected cipher suite in the Server Hello handshake message
                      to be a cipher suite not presented in the Client Hello handshake message. The
                      evaluator shall verify that the client rejects the connection after receiving the
                      Server Hello.</li>

                      Modify the signature block in the Server’s Key

        The baseline requirements for the TOE are fairly limited with respect to I&amp;A, since no formal
        administrative or general purpose users are defined. The extent of the I&amp;A required to be
        performed by the TOE relates to the process of becoming connected to the protected network
        through the Wireless Access System. Additionally, some of the requirements that might
        normally be considered part of the I&amp;A process are specified in other sections of this PP-Module,
        particularly those related to cryptographic protocols used for the wireless communications
        (WPA2). This was done to keep requirements on those protocols grouped together for
        understandability as well as for ease of authoring and applying assurance activities. Therefore, 
        the requirements in this section cover the remaining two aspects of the I&amp;A capabilities the
        TOE must support:
        <ul>
        <li>802.1X-2010 Authentication. The 802.1X-2010 standard (and associated RFCs) specifies
        authentication of a machine for the purposes of accessing a network. This method is
        used as a precursor to wireless operations using the 802.11-2016 standard. While
        802.1X contains requirements for several different parties that participate in 802.1X
        exchanges, the requirements below are targeted at the TOE’s role as a “supplicant” per
        802.1X.</li>
        <li>Credentials. The protocols and mechanisms specified in this and other sections of the PP-Module
        rely on certificates for use in the EAP-TLS exchange in performing the 802.1X
        authentication.</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <div class='comp' id='FIA_PAE_EXT.1'><h4>FIA_PAE_EXT.1 Port Access Entity Authentication</h4>
          
          
          
          
          
          
          
          <div class='element'><div class='reqid' id='FIA_PAE_EXT.1.1'><a class='abbr' href='#FIA_PAE_EXT.1.1'>FIA_PAE_EXT.1.1</a></div><div class='reqdesc'>
            The TSF shall conform to IEEE Standard 802.1X for a Port Access Entity (PAE)
              in the “Supplicant” role.
            
            <div class='appnote'><span class='note-header'>Application Note: </span><span class='note'>
              This requirement covers the TOE's role as the supplicant in an 802.1X
              authentication exchange. If the exchange is completed successfully, the TOE will derive the PMK
              as a result of the EAP-TLS (or other appropriate EAP exchange) and perform the 4-way
              handshake with the wireless access system (authenticator) to begin 802.11 communications.
              <p></p>
              As indicated previously, there are at least two communication paths present during the
              exchange; one with the wireless access system and one with the authentication server that uses
              the wireless access system as a relay. The TOE establishes an EAP over LAN (EAPOL) connection
              with the wireless access system as specified in 802.1X-2010. The TOE and authentication server
              establish an EAP-TLS session (RFC 5216).
              <p></p>
              The point of performing 802.1X authentication is to gain access to the network (assuming the
              authentication was successful and that all 802.11 negotiations are performed successfully); in
              the terminology of 802.1X, this means the TOE will gain access to the "controlled port" maintained 
              by the wireless access system.

              While the TOE is defined as a software package running on a platform defined by the claimed Base-PP, it

      This PP-Module identifies several SFRs from the 
      GPOS PP that are needed to support 
      WLAN Clients functionality.
      This is considered to be consistent because the functionality provided by the 
      GPOS  is being used for its intended purpose.
